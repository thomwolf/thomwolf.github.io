I canâ€™t stop thinking about Â« Low Tech AI Â» which seems the intersection of a couple of fully independent trends I see right now in ai
</p><p>
<strong>Trend 1a/1b: Intelligence</strong>
</p><p>
    <ul>
        <li>1a â€“ AI models size stays generally constant or even decrease nowadays. Todayâ€™s model tend to have similar performances to last yearâ€™s 2 to 10 times larger model (see e.g. Llama/Qwen series or Darioâ€™s chat on Lex podcast)</li>
        <li>
1b â€“ Personal access to a given amount of (multi-core) compute keeps getting quite cheaper <=> for a given price we keep having more compute</li>
    </ul>
</p><p>
These two trends mean that a given level of intelligence keeps being more affordable in price and compute.
</p><p>
<strong> Trend 2: Low complexity AI</strong>
</p><p>
Generally speaking an AI-model-compute-workflow is way simpler than many large scale CPU programs workflow or past AI architectural attempts.
</p><p>
The way AI is build today is interestingly a Â« low branching complexity Â» technology in it-self.
</p><p>
This trend makes the hardware powering AI even simpler than past general compute hardware (see TPUs/AI accelerators/Etched/Fractile/GROQ/Cerebras/etc)
</p><p>
    <strong> Trend 3: Integration in todayâ€™s software stack </strong>
</p><p>
AI is built from human data and as such integrates increasingly (and already decently) well in current human-designed software tech stack
</p><p>
This trend means weâ€™ll even need less and less to upgrade our current tech/software stack API to be able to embed AI in it
</p><p>
    <strong> What this (could) bring </strong>
</p><p>
Overall these trends results in a long term direction of Â« low tech AI Â» â€“ with AI being integrated in very low-tech/cheap stacks
</p><p>
Example 1 is a 5W chips running a highly intelligent algorithm (think a few billion parameters model of the future) with low latency, low energy requirements and an intelligence level soon exceeding GPT3/4 in particular with tool use
</p><p>
Example 2 is a non-AI native business running on current 2000â€™s computer stack and which would basically become almost overnight AI powered with very limited tech changes with drastic change in capabilities
</p><p>
    <strong> Societal </strong>
</p><p>
The combination of both hint at strong societal changes that could diffuse everywhere in a very short amount of time.
</p><p>
A recent related example of that was how the smartphone became the compute of choice in many countries sometimes by-passing/shortcutting wide desktop/laptop adoption. And the magnitude of the impact could be even more massive in the case of AI.
</p><p>
    <strong> A note for the readers out-there </strong>
</p><p>
For the sci-fi readers out there some of this low-tech jump reminds me of the celebrated Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold in which the Barrayar society basically jumped from a "medieval society" straight to "spaceships" almost overnight when rediscovered by the Cetagandans.
</p><p>
Hopefully the jump will be more peaceful in our world.
