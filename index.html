              </p>
              <p>I lead the Science Team at <a href="https://huggingface.co">Huggingface Inc.</a>, a Brooklyn-based startup working on Natural Language Generation and Natural Language Understanding.</p>
              <p>I’ve been programming since I was 10, writing video games and interactive software in <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/155/15599.html">Assembly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thomwolf/Magic-Sand">C/C++</a> but my first career was actually in Physics rather than Computer Science.</p>
              <p>After graduating from <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">Ecole Polytechnique</a> (Paris, France), I worked on laser-plasma interactions at the <a href="http://bella.lbl.gov/">BELLA Center of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (Berkeley, CA). Got accepted for a PhD at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> (Cambridge, MA) but ended up doing my PhD in Statistical/Quantum physics at <a href="http://www.upmc.fr/en/">Sorbonne University</a> and <a href="https://www.espci.fr/en/">ESPCI</a> (Paris, France), working on superconducting materials for the French DARPA (<a href="https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/dga">DGA</a>) and <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a>. After my PhD, I needed a change from the long time scale of experiments in physics and ended up totally changing direction. I joined an IP Law firm, <a href="https://www.plass.com/en">Cabinet Plasseraud</a> (Paris, France), got a law degree from <a href="http://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/">Pantheon Sorbonne University</a> and worked as a <a href="https://patentepi.com/en/">European Patent Attorney</a> for 5 years, assisting a portfolio of startups and big companies to build and defend their Intellectual Property assets.</p>
              <p>In 2015, I was consulting for many Deep-Learning/AI/ML startups and they made me discover the maths behind the new ML/AI revolution. I realised that most of these methods, equations and tools were just re-branded statistical physics approaches which fueled my interest for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I started my online education in AI/ML reading <a href="data/Thom_wolf_reading_list.txt">books and following online courses</a>. About year later, one of my friend asked me if I wanted to join <a href="https://huggingface.co/">his startup</a> to build a science team, and there I was, doing science again and having a lot of fun!

                I like to explain clearly what I have learned and this has lead to a few blog posts that were quite interesting to other as well I guess (they totalise about a quarter million views at the end of 2018). I will try to continue writing things like that when I find the time. I used to be a teacher during my PhD and I do miss teaching. Blogging is my substitute.

                <br> We consider the task of word-level language modeling and study the possibility of combining hidden-states-based short-term representations with medium-term representations encoded in dynamical weights of a language model. Our work extends recent experiments on language models with dynamically evolving weights by casting the language modeling problem into an online learning-to-learn framework in which a meta-learner is trained by gradient-descent to continuously update a language model weights.

                  <br> We reformulate the problem of encoding a multi-scale representation of a sequence in a language model by casting it in a continuous learning framework. We propose a hierarchical multi-scale language model in which short time-scale dependencies are encoded in the hidden state of a lower-level recurrent neural network while longer time-scale dependencies are encoded in the dynamic of the lower-level network by having a meta-learner update the weights of the lower-level neural network in an online meta-learning fashion. We use elastic weights consolidation as a higher-level to prevent catastrophic forgetting in our continuous learning framework.

                    <br> Much effort has been devoted to evaluate whether multi-task learning can be leveraged to learn rich representations that can be used in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) down-stream applications. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the settings in which multi-task learning has a significant effect. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical model trained in a multi-task learning setup on a set of carefully selected semantic tasks. The model is trained in a hierarchical fashion to introduce an inductive bias by supervising a set of low level tasks at the bottom layers of the model and more complex tasks at the top layers of the model. This model achieves state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition, Entity Mention Detection and Relation Extraction without hand-engineered features or external NLP tools like syntactic parsers. The hierarchical training supervision induces a set of shared semantic representations at lower layers of the model. We show that as we move from the bottom to the top layers of the model, the hidden states of the layers tend to represent more complex semantic information.

                      <br> We introduce a new approach to data-driven dialogue systems (e.g. chatbots) called TransferTransfo which is a combination of aTransferlearning based train-ing scheme and a high-capacity generativeTransfo-rmer model.  Fine-tuning isperformed by using a multi-task objective which combines several unsupervised pre-diction tasks. The resulting fine-tuned model shows strong improvements over thecurrent state-of-the-art end-to-end conversational models like memory augmentedseq2seq and information-retrieval models. On the privately held PERSONA-CHATdataset of the Conversational Intelligence Challenge 2, this approach obtains anew state-of-the-art, respectively pushing the perplexity, Hits@1 and F1 metrics to 16.28 (45% absolute improvement),80.7 (46% absolute improvement) and 19.5 (20% absolute improvement).
